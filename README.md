The primary purpose of this project is to improve my skills with OpenGL and C++. Currently my efforts are focused on the rendering aspect of the game, so gameplay is extremely minimal.

In addition to the renderer, I also authored the models and textures. I created them using Blender.

Much of the OpenGL-related code is heavily inspired by the book *Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming* by Jason L. McKesson, since that's my primary resource for learning OpenGL.
